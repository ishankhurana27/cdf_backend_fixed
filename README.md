Common Data Format (CDF) – Data Standardization & Streaming Pipeline
🚀 Overview

This project implements a CDF-based data standardization system to unify data across multiple modules and services.
It defines clear schemas, transformation rules, and a streaming + ETL pipeline that ensures consistent, validated, secure, and highly efficient data flow across the entire architecture.

The system uses Kafka for real-time streaming, Apache NiFi for ETL orchestration, and encrypted Parquet for secure and high-performance storage.

🔍 Key Features
1. Common Data Format (CDF) with Schemas

Centralized CDF schema definitions

Ensures consistent structure across multiple services

Enforces validation rules for every module

Reduces integration issues between teams/systems

2. Transformation Logic Across Modules

Converts raw module-level data into standardized CDF

Handles field mapping, type conversions, normalization, and enrichment

Guarantees end-to-end compatibility across the pipeline

Plug-and-play transformation components

3. Real-Time Kafka Streaming

High-throughput ingestion of data streams

Each module publishes raw data to Kafka topics

Consumers transform data into CDF format before downstream processing

Ensures fault-tolerance and scalability

4. Apache NiFi ETL Pipeline

NiFi flows orchestrate data extraction, transformation, and routing

Drag-and-drop processors for mapping, filtering, validation

Automatic retries, batching, and flow control

Supports integration with storage (S3/HDFS), PostgreSQL, analytics layers

5. Secure, Efficient Parquet Storage

CDF-converted data stored in encrypted Parquet files

Columnar storage boosts query speed and compression

Ensures enterprise-grade security for sensitive data

Enables downstream analytics, ML pipelines, and archival

🏗️ System Architecture

Raw data generated by multiple modules

Kafka producers publish records

Kafka consumers + NiFi flows extract and process data

Transformation logic applies CDF schema

Validated CDF data stored as encrypted Parquet

Data consumed by analytics, reporting, and ML systems

🧠 Why This Project Matters
